# BeatPop

A rhythm based game built with the Phaser 3 library. There are currently only 3 songs in the game but more can be added easily. The game map is created by the mp3 file. The mp3 file is parsed with the Web Audio API that is built right into the browser. The data collected from the Web Audio API is used to generate particles at specific time intervals and velocities.

## Getting Started
I will have a link to the production site. However to get started tweaking the game, clone down the repo and in any game file with a song. Then you can change the title, particle image, background and the mp3 file associated with that game file. 

### Prerequisites

Everything you need should be in this repo, since Phaser is hooked up using a CDN.

## Deployment

This app is deployed on Heroku. Normally heroku does not host static site but you can write a line of PHP to push out your static files and trick Heroku into thinking youre hosting a PHP app.

## Built With

* [Phaser3 Game Engine](https://phaser.io/) - Desktop and Mobile Web Game Framework.
* Vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.
